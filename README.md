# stats-ml-practice
practicing statistics and machine learning concepts using python

This repository was created to help me practice concepts from statistics and machine learning, and to reproduce equations and/or algorithms I encountered in textbooks as Python code. That is to say, I want to write out estimation strategies and algorithms using actual equations before I use any pre-built functions. My goal is to develop a deeper understanding of both commonly used statistical methods and machine learning algorithms.
